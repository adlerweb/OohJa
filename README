========================
 OohJa - Opsi ohne Java
========================

OohJa is a PHP-based replacement of the Java-GUI included in the
client management system "OPSI" (Open PC Server Integration, www.opsi.org).
It was designed becaue the author hates java - especially if JRE takes
hours to load or is broken on a PC (again...). ;)

OohJa is currently in an early developement stage - some parts may work,
most do not. Patches accepted, deadlines not.
